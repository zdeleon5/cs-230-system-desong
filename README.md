Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
- The client was the creator of the software. They wanted to design a turn based, real-time drawing game that included a client-server type architechture.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
- I believe I did best in reasearching the pros and cons of selecting each operating system for the different parts of the system.
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
- I found the object diagrams the most helpful. Having a UML on hand really allows for the developer to understand and properly implement an object-oriented design.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I would revise the final recommendations. I could have gone into more detail about the different feuatures that made each recommended operating platform worth using.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- I put myself in the end-user's shoes when designing the system. I believe this is the best way to apprach a task of this sort, as the end-user's satisfaction is ultimately what determines what feautures end up in the final project design.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
- I apporached it incrementally, I wanted to first have a mininmum viable product then start adding feautures. This will avoid scope creep. I will leverage the use of the different UML diagrams in the fututre, as they provide a great representation.
